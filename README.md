# Weather EPD

Run the APP:

$ cd ~/weather_app
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ sudo python -m display.scratch

# TODO:
* Figure out which font to use. There are some Arial packages online
* Keep implementing the DisplayManager so it can abstract the rendering
* 

# Notes

* They can be convered here: https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-bmp
* They icons should be convered at a pixel density of 500
